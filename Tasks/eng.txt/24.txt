Task 1.
Create an application for a car dealership. Necessary
store information about cars sold
(name, year of manufacture, engine size, price). Implement
interface for adding data, deleting data,
data display, data sorting by various
parameters, data search by various parameters.
When implementing, use containers, functors
and algorithms.

Task 2.
A vector container holds a set of integers.
Create functors to solve the following problems:
1. Finding the minimum value;
2. Search for the maximum value;
3. Sort data in descending order;
4. Sort data in ascending order;
5. Increasing the values ​​in the container by a given constant;
6. Reducing the values ​​in the container by a given constant;
7. Removing elements from the container equal to the desired value.
Don't forget to use algorithms where necessary.

Task 3.
Change the functors from the first assignment to template ones
functor classes. Check the work of the resulting solution
on different containers with different contents.

Task 1.
Add an exception handling mechanism to the doubly linked list class. Throw exceptions of your choice
in case of errors. For example, lack of memory, attempt
removal from an empty list, etc.

Task 2.
Create a hierarchy of custom exception classes. It should have classes for different situations. Use your practice and homework assignments as the subject area. For example, there should be classes to handle all sorts of math errors, out of memory, file handling problems, and so on.

Task 3.
As part of the previous self-study and homework assignments, you created a set of classes for working with various
primitive mathematical operations (fraction,
point in two-dimensional space, point in three-dimensional space, etc.). Place already created classes in
namespaces. Think of the right structure
created spaces. Using the mechanism of spaces
write code to test the resulting solution.

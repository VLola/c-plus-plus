Topic: Multidimensional arrays

Task 1:
Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array and fills it in the following way:
the user enters a number (for example, 3) the first element of the array takes the value of this number,
the next element of the array takes on the value of that number
multiplied by 2 (i.e. 6 for our example),
the third element of the array is the previous element,
multiplied by 2 (i.e. 6*2=12 for our example).
Display the created array.

Task 2:
Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array and fills it with the following
principle: the user enters a number (for example, 3) the first element of the array takes
the value of this number, the next element of the array takes the value of this number + 1 (i.e. 4
for our example), the third element of the array is the previous element + 1 (i.e. 5 for our
example). Display the created array.

Task 3:
Create a 2D array.
Fill it with random numbers and show it on the screen.
The user selects the number of shifts and position (left, right, up, down).
Shift the array and display the result on the screen. The shift is cyclic.
For example, if we have the following array
 1 2 0 4 5 3
 4 5 3 9 0 1
 and the user has chosen to shift 2 digits to the right, we get
 5 3 1 2 0 4
 0 1 4 5 3 9
 
Task 4:
In a two-dimensional array of integers, calculate:
The sum of all array elements
Arithmetic mean of all array elements
Minimum element
Maximum element

Task 5:
In a two-dimensional array of integers, calculate the sum of the elements: in each row;
in each column;
simultaneously for all rows and all columns.
Set up as follows:
 3 5 6 7 | 21
 12 1 1 1 | 15
 0 7 12 1 | 20
 --------------
15 3 19 9 | 56

Task 6:
Write a program that declares a 5x10 array and a 5x5 array.
The first array is filled with random numbers,
in the range from 0 to 50.
The second array is filled in the following way:
the first element of the second array is equal to the sum of the first
and the second element of the first array,
the second element of the second array is equal to the sum of the third and fourth element of the first array.

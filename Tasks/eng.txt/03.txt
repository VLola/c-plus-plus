Task 1: 
Display figures filled with asterisks on the screen. To implement a dialogue with the user using the menu.

Task 2: 
Count the number of integers in the range from 100 to 999 that have two identical digits

Task 3: 
Count the number of integers in the range from 100 to 999 in which all digits are different

Task 4: 
The user enters any integer. It is necessary to remove from this integer
all numbers 3 and 6 and display back on the screen.

Task 5: 
The user enters any integer A. It is necessary to display all the integers B,
for which A is divisible without remainder by B*B
and do not divide without a remainder by B * B * B

Task 6: 
The user enters an integer A.
The program must determine
that the cube of the sum of the digits of this number is A * A

Task 1:
 Create an abstract base class Employer
with a purely virtual Print() function.
Create three derived classes: President, Manager,
Worker.Override the Print() function for output
information relevant to each type of employee.

Task 2:
 Create base class list.Implement on base
list stack and queue with virtual functions
insertion and extraction.

Task 3:
 Create abstract base class with virtual
function - area. Create derived classes:
rectangle, circle, right triangle,
trapezium with its area functions. To check
ki define an array of references to an abstract class,
which are assigned addresses of various objects.

Task 4:
 Create abstract base class with virtual
function - the roots of the equation. Create derivatives
classes : class of linear equations and class of square
equations. Define the calculation function

Topic: Sorting arrays

Task 1:
Write a program that sorts a one-dimensional array of integers using bubble sort.

Task 2.
Write a program that sorts a one-dimensional array of integers using the insertion method.

Task 3.
Write a success program. The user enters 10 student grades.
Implement a menu for the user.
Output ratings (output the contents of the array).
Retake the exam (the user enters the number of the array element and a new grade).
Does the scholarship come out (the scholarship comes out if the average score is not lower than 10.7).

Task 4.
Sort the first two thirds of the array in ascending order,
if the arithmetic mean of all elements is greater than zero; otherwise, only the first third.
The rest of the array is not sorted, but arranged in reverse order.

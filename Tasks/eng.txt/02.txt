Task 1: 
Write a program that calculates the sum of integers from a to 500 (the value of a is entered from the keyboard).

Task 2: 
Write a program that asks for two integers x and y, after which
calculates and prints the value of x to the power of y.

Task 3:
Find the arithmetic mean of all integers from 1 to 1000.

Task 4:
Find the product of all integers from a to 20 (the value of a is entered from the keyboard:
1 <=a <= 20).

Task 5:
Write a program that displays the multiplication table for k,
where k is the variant number. For example, for the 7th option:
 7 x 2 = 14
 7 x 3 = 21

Task 6:
Display all numbers from zero to the number entered by the user.

Task 7:
The user enters two limits of the range, display all the numbers from this
range. Provide for the user to enter range boundaries in any order.
print all even numbers from the range.
print all odd numbers from the range.
print all numbers that are multiples of seven.

Task 8:
The user enters two range limits. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the range.

Task 9:
The user enters numbers from the keyboard. Calculate their sum and display on the screen,
as soon as the user enters zero.

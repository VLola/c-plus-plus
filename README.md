doubly linked list.
+ 2. Create a template container class Array, which
is an array that can store objects of the given type. 
The class must implement the following features:

elements for which memory is allocated);
  + B) SetSize(int size, int grow = 1) - setting the size of the array (if the size parameter is greater than the previous size array, an additional block of memory is allocated, if not, then the "extra" elements are lost and the memory freed up); the grow parameter determines how many elements to allocate memory for if the number of elements exceeds the current size of the array. For example, SetSize(5, 5); means that when adding the 6th element, the size array becomes equal to 10, when adding 11th - 15th, etc.;

index in the array. For example, if with an array size of 10, you add 4 elements to it, then the function will return 3;

  + E) FreeExtra - remove "extra" memory (above the last valid index);
  + F) RemoveAll - remove everything;
  + G) GetAt - getting a specific element (by
index);

less than the current size of the array);

functions;
  + J) Add - adding an element to the array (if necessary, the array is increased by the value of the grow function SetSize);
  + K) Append - "addition" of two arrays;
  + L) operator =;
  + M) GetData - get the address of the array with data;
  + N) InsertAt - insert element(s) at a given position
  + O) RemoveAt - remove element(s) from a given position
